                How Firefly Got His Light<br>
                by Daniel Errico<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
Long ago, there was no such thing as nighttime. Sun and Moon were the best of friends and they never left the sky. Moon looked after the quiet oceans, and Sun shone brightly over all the land. Elephant lived on the plains. The sunlight made his skin very hot. He tried to cool off in a mud bath, but Sun dried it up. He tried fanning himself, but his ears got tired<br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
One day he called out to Sun, “You dry the ground and burn my feet! I cannot stand this awful heat!” But Sun did not listen, and Moon did not say a word. Owl lived in a tall tree in the forest. She could not hunt in the sunlight. She tried to catch Mouse for dinner, but Mouse saw her coming and ran away. She tried eating berries instead, but they did not fill her up.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
One day she called out to Sun, “Mouse can see me in the light, I cannot hunt with you so bright!” But Sun did not listen, and Moon did not say a word. Baby Turtle hatched on the beach by the ocean. To reach the sea, he needed the tides to pull him in. He tried to swim out, but the waves pushed him back on shore. He waited for the tides to come, but they never did.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
One day he called out to Moon, “I need the tides to reach the seas, I beg of you to bring them please!” Moon heard the animals and she asked Sun if there was a way they could help them. Sun cared deeply for Moon and he agreed. Together they came up with a plan. Sun called down to all the animals. “For the sake of Elephant, Owl and Baby Turtle, Moon and I have decided to share the sky. When I rise, Moon will set and leave the sky bright.  When Moon rises, I will set and leave the sky dark. "Moon will bring the tides each day as she travels through the sky and it will be cool and dark." Sun continued. "And when I rise, I will once again make the sky bright..." But we need one of you tell us when it is time for us to switch.”
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
“It cannot be me,” said Elephant, “for I am forgetful.” And this was a lie. “It cannot be me,” said Owl,” “for I cannot be trusted.” And this was the truth. “It cannot be me,” said Baby Turtle, “for I am just a baby.” And this could not be argued. One by one, the animals declined except for Dullfly, who was resting in the shade of a banana leaf. Sun shone his great heat on Dullfly and spoke to him a booming voice. “Dullfly, this is Sun! Do you hear me?” “From now on, you will tell me when it is time for me to set, and we will call it dusk. And you will tell Moon when it is time for her to set, and we will call it dawn.” “I cannot!” Dullfly said, frightened by Sun’s loud command. “I am too small for you to see!”
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
Sun exhaled and shot a burst of light straight into Dullfly’s body, making it glow brightly. “There. From now on you will be known as Firefly, and you will flash your light to send us a signal,” said Sun. And from that day forth, Firefly did just that. So, if you happen to catch Firefly at dawn or dusk, you must be sure to let him go, because it is he who decides when Moon brings the tides, and when Sun rises and sets.

                Why the Cricket Chirps<br>
                by Daniel Errico<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
Before there were seasons, the cricket could fly. He flew faster than the bumblebee. He flew higher than the falcon. And he flew fancier than the flying marmaduck (who was quite a fancy flier).<br>
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
The cricket had flown all over the world. He flew to the East. Then he flew to the West. And then he flew to the South. But he had never flown North.<br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
The ant tried to warn him that he should not try. “It’s very cold up north,” said the Ant. “Too cold for an ant and too cold for a cricket.”
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
The cricket, however, did not listen, because crickets do whatever they want. He set off for the North that very night. It did not take him long to get there because he was such a fantastically fast and fancy flier. The cricket landed next to a pine tree as the sun began setting.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
There was snow everywhere he looked. There was snow on the trees. There was snow on the ground. And there was snow on top of the mountains.The Moose came walking over to him very slowly. “Ohhhh…Hello,” said the moose. “Bundle up, nighttime is coming.”
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
The cricket did not listen, because crickets do whatever they want. He flew up into a pine tree to settle in for a good sleep. He did this quickly because he is such an incredibly fast and fancy flier. The Owl came flying over to the same branch. “You should find some shelter from the cold night,” said the owl.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
The cricket did not listen, because crickets do whatever they want. He decided to rest on a pile of twigs. He was sleepier than he had ever been, from all the remarkably fast and fancy flying. The cricket slept all through the night until morning. When he woke up he was ready to go home and tell the ant about his trip. He hopped high in the air to start flying, but he couldn’t. Instead he fell right back into the snow. He hopped again, even higher this time, but his wings would not work. They had frozen solid during the cold night.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
He tried to warm them up by rubbing them together but it was no use. The cricket had to hop all the way home. It took him days and days to return. By the time he got back, his wings had almost become unfrozen. When he rubbed them together this time, they made a chirping noise that no one in the forest had ever heard before. And every time he rubbed his wings together they chirped a little bit louder and got a little less frozen. But it is important to know, dear reader, that wings are special and fragile things. This is why the greatest care should always be taken around them. They are not meant to be frozen, and once they are, they may never be the same again.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px; text-align: justify;" class="text-size-20 margin-bottom-10 text-strong text-sentence case text-dark">
Even though the cricket’s wings were no longer frozen, he still could not fly. And ever since then the cricket stays on the ground like his friend the ant, and hops from place to place. And now the cricket is the fastest and fanciest hopper there is. At nighttime, you can hear him chirping, from rubbing his wings together to keep warm. But he is doing much more than just that. The cricket is telling you how warm or cold it is by chirping. He chirps faster when it is warm, and slower when it is cold. This way, you will not make the same mistake that he did. However, that is only if you decide to listen.<br>

<br>
*Dolbear’s Law states that if you count the number of time a cricket chirps in 15 seconds, and add 40, it will give you (roughly) the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

                When do Hippos Play?<br>

By the African river, know as the Nile,<br>

The sun fell away and it rested a while.<br>
<br>
 <br>

The rhinos had braved all the smoldering heat.<br>

They lay down to sleep as they wiped off their feet.<br>

 <br>
<br>
 

The elephants marched to their elephant beds,<br>

And gently they rested their elephant heads.<br>
<br>
 
<br>
The hippos went bathing in cool, shallow pools,<br>

Thinking the rhinos and elephants fools.<br>

 <br>
<br>
 

Slowly the hippos sank into the river,<br>

The water so cold that it gave them a shiver.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Hippos can't swim, like the pelicans think.<br>

They also can't float- they could easily sink.)<br>

 <br>
<br>
 

Underwater, they fell to the soft river bed,<br>

On darkish green plants with a smidgen of red.<br>
<br>
<br> 

They strolled on the bottom, then bounced up for air.<br>

They did it for hours, without any care.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 

The fish followed closely, and wove in an out,<br>

Under their belly, and up to their snout.<br>
<br>
 <br>

Each of the hippos came up to the shore,<br>

To feed on the grass by the river once more.<br>
<br>
<br>
They dried off their bodies by shaking and stomping,<br>

And took bites of grass, chewing and chomping.<br>
<br>
<br>
With night fading fast, they were full from the feast.<br>

The sun returned back, rising up from the east.<br>
<br>
 <br>
The hippos crept off to collapse for the day,<br>

While rhinos and elephants got up to play.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enjoying the warmth of the sun and its light,<br>

Never knowing the story of hippos at night.<br>
